# Project Context - Streamlit Radio Campaign Management System

## Project Overview
Spanish-language Streamlit application for managing radio transmission orders and campaigns (Órdenes/Pautas de Transmisión Radio). The application handles campaign creation, material management, transmission scheduling, and financial calculations for radio advertising.

## Current Project Status

### ⚠️ BLOCKED - Snowflake Edition Limitation

**Current Phase**: Docker Container Deployment to Snowpark Container Services
**Blocking Issue**: Snowpark Container Services requires Business Critical edition (currently on Enterprise)

### Architecture Status
- ✅ **Application Development**: Complete - Single-file Streamlit app (`streamlit_app.py`)
- ✅ **Docker Containerization**: Complete - Docker image built and ready
- ❌ **Snowflake Deployment**: Blocked - Cannot push to Snowflake registry
- ❌ **Production Deployment**: Pending - Awaiting edition upgrade

### Infrastructure Details
- **Snowflake Account**: `BEIKXLH-MULTIMEDIOS` (Account Locator: `CA72080`)
- **Current Edition**: Enterprise
- **Required Edition**: Business Critical or higher
- **User**: `US_ECALDERONG` (PERSON type, ACCOUNTADMIN role)
- **Database**: `DB_ANALYTICS_DEV`
- **Schema**: `SCH_DIR_TEC`

### Docker Configuration
- **Registry URL**: `beikxlh-multimedios.registry.snowflakecomputing.com`
- **Image Repository**: `streamlit_app_repo` 
- **Image Tag**: `streamlit-radio-app:latest`
- **Docker Files**: 
  - `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build with Python 3.11
  - `docker-compose.yml` - Local development environment
  - `push_image.sh` - Deployment script (authentication tested)

### Migration Context
**From**: Native Snowflake Streamlit (has performance and functionality limitations)
**To**: Snowpark Container Services (containerized deployment)
**Reason**: Resolve JavaScript component limitations, file upload issues, UI responsiveness problems

## Next Steps

### Immediate Action Required
1. **Contact Snowflake Account Manager** to upgrade from Enterprise to Business Critical edition
2. **Business Justification**: Enable Snowpark Container Services for containerized Streamlit deployment

### Post-Upgrade Actions (Ready to Execute)
1. Push Docker image to Snowflake registry using existing `push_image.sh` script
2. Execute SQL commands from `snowflake_setup.sql` to create services
3. Deploy and test containerized application
4. Migrate data and user workflows from native Streamlit

### Files Ready for Deployment
- `snowflake_setup.sql` - Complete setup script for compute pools, image repositories, and services
- `push_image.sh` - Tested authentication script (credentials confirmed working)
- `debug_registry.sql` - Troubleshooting SQL commands
- Docker configuration files ready for production

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Technical Risk**: All code and configuration completed and tested
- **High Business Risk**: Project blocked until edition upgrade approved
- **Timeline Impact**: Deployment ready within hours of edition upgrade

## Alternative Options Evaluated
1. **Native Snowflake Streamlit**: Rejected due to known limitations
2. **External Cloud Deployment**: Possible fallback but loses Snowflake integration benefits
3. **Different Container Registry**: Not viable - requires Snowflake-native registry for proper integration
