# Alternative Docker Push Methods

Since we're having authentication issues, here are a few things to try:

## Option 1: Check Registry URL Format
Run this SQL in Snowflake to get the correct registry URL:
```sql
SHOW IMAGE REPOSITORIES;
SELECT SYSTEM$REGISTRY_LIST_IMAGES('streamlit_app_repo');
SELECT CURRENT_ACCOUNT() as account_name;
```

## Option 2: Try Different Account Formats
The account identifier might need to be in a different format:

```bash
# Try with orgname-account format (current)
docker login beikxlh-multimedios.registry.snowflakecomputing.com -u US_ECALDERONG

# Or try with just the account locator (if you know it)
# docker login ACCOUNT_LOCATOR.registry.snowflakecomputing.com -u US_ECALDERONG
```

## Option 3: Manual Push via Browser
1. Go to your Snowflake account
2. Navigate to Data > Private Sharing > Image Repositories
3. Click on `streamlit_app_repo`
4. Look for upload instructions or registry details

## Option 4: Use SnowSQL
If you have SnowSQL installed, you might be able to use it for image operations:
```bash
snowsql -a BEIKXLH-MULTIMEDIOS -u US_ECALDERONG
```

## Option 5: Check Username Format
Sometimes the username needs to be different for registry access:
- Try: `US_ECALDERONG`
- Try: `us_ecalderong` 
- Try: `BEIKXLH-MULTIMEDIOS.US_ECALDERONG`

Let me know what the `SHOW IMAGE REPOSITORIES;` command shows in Snowflake - it should give us the exact registry URL format to use.
